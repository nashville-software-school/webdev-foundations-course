# Book 2 - The Invisible Web

In this book, you will learn some fundamental concepts and skills in writing the logic and operations that power modern websites in the JavaScript language. The first three months at Nashville Software School focuses almost exclusively on building applications for the browser with JavaScript.

Making as much progress on JavaScript is **critical** to your success early in the course.
