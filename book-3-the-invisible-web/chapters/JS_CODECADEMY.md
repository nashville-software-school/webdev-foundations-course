# JavaScript on Codecademy

Your next assignment is to go through the [Introduction To JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course on Codecademy.

CAUTION: You only need to work through chapters 1-8 to be prepared for Nashville Software School. You can choose to go beyond chapter 8 if you wish, but the concepts become much more difficult after that and you will likely have diminishing returns on your time investment.
