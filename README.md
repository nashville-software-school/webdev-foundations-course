# Welcome to Nashville Software School!


Thank you for choosing us to guide you through your journey to become a software developer!

We want to ensure that you are as prepared as possible for the technologies and concepts that your instruction staff will be coaching you through in the first few weeks, so we have prepared a **Foundations Course**. These resources will provide you with the basic skills, terminology, and context for what it will be like at Nashville Software School.

## Foundations Course is Mandatory

If you don't do the **Foundations Course**, you will be immediately behind your teammates on the first day of class and will likely need to drop to the next cohort so that you have time to complete it.

Nashville Software School is an accelerated bootcamp, and you will hit the ground running on day one. We will assume that you've completed this work, and provide minimal resources to you if you have not. Additionally, the life of a software developer is one of focus and meeting committments. Completing the **Foundations Course** shows us that you have the ability to prioritize this work, can focus on it, and meet the committment of completing it.

## Time to get started!

Visit [Book 1 - Getting Started](./book-1-your-computer/README.md) to learn the basics of using your computer and using your keyboard. These are crucial to start with because you will be typing more than you ever have before (unless you're a novelist), and being comfortable with using keyboard shortcuts will save you a tremendous amount of time while you are coding.
