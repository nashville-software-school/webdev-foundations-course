# HTML

Your first step is to learn how to work with the language that software developers use to structure the content within web pages - HTML.

## Assignment

Visit and complete the [Introduction to HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) course on Codecademy. They estimate that it will take four hours of your time to read the content, work on exercises, and complete the project(s) they assign you. We want you to start with this course because it has you coding immediately, not doing a lot of reading about theory.
