# Book 3 - The Visible Web

In this book, you will learn some fundamental concepts and skills in building HTML and CSS to build the part of software that humans interact with on web sites. As always, you are encouraged to reach out for help if you struggle with any of the steps or code in this book.

> **Important:** If you did not complete Book 2 to 100% completion, you must go back and do that. This book covers HTML and CSS, which is a miniscule part of the course. If you do not complete your JavaScript course, then you aren't prepared for NSS. We would rather you go back and do the JavaScript course **all over again** than spend too much time on HTML and CSS.
