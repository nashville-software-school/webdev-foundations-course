# Ditching the Dock Bar

As a Mac user, you most likely are used to using your mouse to navigate the operating system. Software developers use their keyboard for as many things as possible to accelerate their workflow and save time. This takes time, patient, and practice. In this chapter, you are going to learn how to start applications with your keyboard instead of clicking on an application on your desktop or in the Dock Bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Using Spotlight

Press the command key, keep it held down, and then tap your spacebar key. A new window will appear in the middle of your screen. This is the *Spotlight Search*. Then type in the word "terminal", and the Terminal application will show up as one of the results. In fact, it should be the top result and will be highlighted in blue. Since that is the top result, you can then just press return and the terminal application will run.


1. Use the Spotlight Search to launch Google Chrome (use "chrome" to search)
1. Use the Spotlight Search to launch Visual Studio Code (use "code" to search)
